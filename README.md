We were provided with a raw dataset https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks#attacks.csv about sharks attacks registered: time and date when they where registered, characteristics of the victim, lethality of the attacks and details about how the events were investigated.

Our objetive is to clean the dataset until we have a database we can work with and contrast the next three hypothesis:

1. Most of the provoked sharks attacks are provoked by Americans.
2. Distribution of sharks attacks is correlated with the Age of the victim
3. Sharks attacks ocurrs mainly in the afternoon
